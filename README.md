The following design has the following problem:
The SmartPhone interface defines methods for making calls, sending SMS, browsing the web, and taking pictures.
While  smartphones (Iphone and Samsung) can utilize all functionalities, a basic phone (BasicPhone) only needs calling and SMS capabilities.
Forcing the BasicPhone class to implement unused methods (browseWeb and takePicture) violates ISP.
